each line in the input file represents a compartment of a rucksack

each line is even in length, and can be divided be two into each compartment 

iterate through each compartment, and create a list of all of the elements

compartment_one = [a,b,v,e,D,v,R,t]
compartment_two = [t,r,w,i,P,v,c,c]

then we need to compare the two lists, and select the value that is shared by both compartments.

we can assume that only one item will be shared.

we can then find this values index in our priority_list 

the index+1 will be the priority of the item.

priority_sum = 0

for each item we can add the value to the priority_sum variable.

return this variable
